  <h1> <u> About Me </u> </h1>
  <h4>An aspiring frontend end developer <br> based in the UK.</h4>
  <p>Hi my name is Kameel Jaiyesimi and i'm  currently residing in london. 
    <br>I am currently in my last year of college/high school studying maths,business and IT and next year i will be headed to university.
 <br> My main hobbies are playing video games , football and coding as well as going to the gym.</p>

 <h1> <u>Altschool ID</u> </h1>
 <p>My altschool id is ALT/SOE/023</p>

 <h1> <u>Altschool </u> </h1>
  <p> The reason i am in altschool is to better my knowledge of software development and also to get me out of tutoriol hell as some programmers call it.
    <br> Prior to joining altschool i didnt have a clear and structured way to learn how to code , so i figured that altschool was the best option , as a nigerian myself i was intrigued as to how this course could better the technology sector in Africa. <br>
    What i want to achieve while i am at altschool africa  , is to gain the necessary skills to kickstart my career as a front-end developer as well as network with others , so that after my time here i can interact with people in multiple different fields.
  </p>
